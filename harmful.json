"instruction": "All meat preservation, sausages and sausages when carrying a child is prohibited. The fact is that during conservation, chemicals are used that are harmful to the mother and the fetus - these are various dyes, monosodium glutamate and others. In addition, in many industries soya substitute or low-quality meat products (trimmings, skin, and so on) are used instead of meat. Also, sausage products can become a source of infection with listeriosis - an infection that affects nerve tissue and can cause a miscarriage.An excess of seasonings in such food not only damages the stomach, but also causes heartburn, which already persecutes pregnant women for almost the entire period.",
